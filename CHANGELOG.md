## Version 3.3.1 - Simultaneous Playback Fix (2025-07-25)

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed "Play Same Videos in All Devices Simultaneously"**: Resolved an issue where videos were not playing correctly on all devices. The fix ensures:
  - Proper initialization of YouTube on all devices before video playback.
  - Improved intent handling for opening video URLs.
  - Added a tap action to ensure video playback starts reliably.
  - Enhanced synchronization between devices during simultaneous video playback.
  - The feature now correctly plays all specified videos sequentially across all selected devices, waiting for each video to complete before moving to the next.



## Version 3.3.2 - Direct Video Playback Fix (2025-07-25)

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Direct Video Playback**: Addressed the issue where videos were not playing directly within the YouTube app. The fix ensures:
  - Removed the redundant step of explicitly opening the YouTube app before playing a video.
  - Video URLs are now directly opened using `android.intent.action.VIEW`, which automatically launches the YouTube app and plays the video.
  - This applies to both "Play Same Videos in All Devices Simultaneously" and the standard sequential playback modes, ensuring consistent and reliable video playback.



## Version 3.3.3 - Refined YouTube Playback & Simplified Logic (2025-07-25)

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Resolved "Cannot Open URL" Issue**: Fixed the persistent problem where YouTube videos were not playing and a "cannot open URL" toast message appeared. The solution involves:
  - **Direct Video URL Intent**: The application now exclusively uses `android.intent.action.VIEW` with the video URL, which is the most reliable method for triggering direct playback within the YouTube app.
  - Removed alternative, less reliable ADB commands for opening YouTube videos.

### ‚ú® Enhancements
- **Simplified YouTube Automation Logic**: The backend script (`scripts.py`) has been significantly streamlined:
  - All video playback (single video, multiple videos, channel videos) is now handled by a single, unified logic.
  - Removed redundant options like "Sequential Playback" and "Play Same Videos in All Devices Simultaneously" from the frontend, as the new backend logic inherently supports these behaviors.
- **Cleaned Frontend UI**: The YouTube automation section in `index.html` and `script.js` has been updated to reflect the simplified options, making the interface cleaner and more intuitive.

This update provides a more robust and user-friendly YouTube automation experience, focusing on reliable video playback and a simplified interface.
