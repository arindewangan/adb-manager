- Run `adb devices` in terminal to verify ADB can see devices
- Try different USB cables or ports

**Permission Denied:**
- Authorize the computer on Android device when prompted
- Check that developer options are enabled

**Script Execution Fails:**
- Ensure target apps are installed on devices
- Check device screen is unlocked
- Verify network connectivity for web-based scripts

**File Upload Issues:**
- Check file format matches requirements
- Ensure file size is under 16MB
- Use supported file types (.txt, .csv, .json)

### Performance Tips

**For Multiple Devices:**
- Use USB hubs with individual power switches
- Ensure adequate power supply for all devices
- Consider device processing capabilities for complex scripts

**For YouTube Automation:**
- Use shorter video lists for faster execution
- Enable shuffle for varied content consumption
- Monitor device battery levels during long sessions

**For Proxy Setup:**
- Verify proxy servers are accessible
- Test proxy functionality before bulk assignment
- Keep proxy lists updated and valid

## Security Considerations

- Keep device unlock patterns/passwords secure
- Use trusted proxy servers only
- Regularly update ADB and device software
- Monitor script execution for unexpected behavior
- Secure uploaded files containing sensitive information
